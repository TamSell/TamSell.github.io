        <p>This is my most recent project, Jumpi Jumper. A 3D platformer that I developed the renderer and physics engine for. 
            I spent many hours working on this project.</p>

        <p>This project titled Star Penguin was a project I worked with a team on to create. My teammates handled the renderer which was vulkan 
            based, while I handled the engine side using FLECS. This was my first time using and learning about an ECS style project. It was super
            informative and helped to learn important engine architecture that I utilized in my most recent project Jumpi Jumper.

        <p>This project I worked with a group and utilized the Unity engine. We created an arena shooter that requires high paced reactions
            and gameplay. For this project I worked on the enemy system, which include tracking, hitboxes, behaviors and the menu system.
