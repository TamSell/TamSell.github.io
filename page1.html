        <p>This is my most recent project, Jumpi Jumper. This game is a simple 3D platformer that incorporates jumping and tight movement with
            pickups and a time limit. On this project I created the basic renderer utilizing DirectX 11 to take in models, position and orientation data 
            to display the proper items on screen. On this project I created a physics engine that incorporates 3 shapes (AABB's, OBB's, Spheres) and planes.
            With this simple physics engine I created a game object system that allows for unique behaviors and interactions per game object.

        <p>This project titled Star Penguin was a project I worked with a team on to create. My teammates handled the renderer which was vulkan 
            based, while I handled the engine side using FLECS. This was my first time using and learning about an ECS style project. It was super
            informative and helped to learn important engine architecture that I utilized in my most recent project Jumpi Jumper. For this project
            I developed the player movement, combat, enemy movement and menu systems.

        <p>This project I worked with a group and utilized the Unity engine. We created an arena shooter that requires high paced reactions
            and gameplay. For this project I worked on the enemy system, which include tracking, hitboxes, behaviors and the menu system. I created
            an AI turret system that predicted player movement. This system was also incorporated into the chasing melee enemies that worked to cut off 
            the player based off the shortest path to them. The ranged enemies system worked to get within a range of the player then weave around so as 
            to dodge the players aim.
